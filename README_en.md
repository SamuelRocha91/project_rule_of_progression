## Project Description

Java is one of the most popular programming languages, known for its portability and robustness. In the "Progression Rules" project, fundamental knowledge of the Java language and its tools was exercised, including:

- Conscious use of primitive and non-primitive types.
- Manipulation of input and output data.
- Control structures and conditionals.
- Use of JDK and Maven (MVN).
- Development in IntelliJ IDEA.Se precisar de mais alguma coisa, √© s√≥ avisar!

In this project, the `App` class was implemented, located in the `src` folder, which contains a method responsible for collecting user information, as well as a method for manipulating this data. The goal is to allow the user to enter the number of assessments performed, their names, grades, and respective weights, thus enabling the issuance of a pass or fail verdict.

  - **Grade Collection**: Allows the user to register assessments, providing name, weight, and grade.
  - **Percentage Calculation**: Evaluates the weighted average of grades and determines the student's status (pass or fail) based on the minimum score.

  <summary><h2>Usage Example</h2></summary>
  The code below illustrates how information is collected and processed:
  
  ```java
  public static void collectGrades() {
      // Logic for collecting and processing grades
  }
  ```
