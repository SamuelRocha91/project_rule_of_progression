## Project Description

Java is one of the most popular programming languages, renowned for its portability and robustness. In the "Rule of Progression" project, fundamental knowledge about Java and its tools was exercised, including:

- Conscious use of primitive and non-primitive types.
- Input and output data manipulation.
- Control structures (loops and conditionals).
- Utilizing JDK and Maven (MVN).
- Development in IntelliJ IDEA.

In this project, the `App` class was implemented in the `src` folder, which contains a method responsible for collecting user information, along with another method for processing that data. The goal is to allow users to input the number of evaluations performed, their names, grades, and respective weights, thereby enabling the issuance of an approval or disapproval verdict.

### Features

- **Grade Collection**: Allows the user to register evaluations by providing names, weights, and grades.
- **Percentage Calculation**: Evaluates the weighted average of grades and determines the student's status (approval or disapproval) based on the minimum score required.

### Example Usage

The code below illustrates how information is collected and processed:

```java
public static void coletarNotas() {
    // Logic for collecting and processing grades
}
```

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: For building applications and REST APIs.
- **Maven**: Project management tool for Java.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: IDE used for development.
